# Security and Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the security and performance optimizations implemented for the PatientCare healthcare booking platform.

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Data Encryption (`src/utils/encryption.ts`)
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for sensitive healthcare data
- **Authenticated encryption** with additional data (AAD) for integrity
- **Separate encryption methods** for medical data and PII
- **Secure key management** via environment variables
- **Hash functions** for searchable encrypted data

**Key Features:**
- Encrypts medical records (diagnosis, prescriptions, notes)
- Encrypts PII (SSN, phone numbers, addresses)
- Automatic encryption/decryption middleware
- Secure random key generation

### 2. Enhanced Security Middleware (`src/middleware/security.ts`)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers
- **Rate limiting** with different tiers for sensitive endpoints
- **Input sanitization** to prevent XSS attacks
- **IP whitelisting** for admin endpoints
- **Security logging** for audit trails

**Rate Limiting Tiers:**
- Authentication endpoints: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- Payment endpoints: 3 attempts per minute
- File uploads: 10 uploads per minute
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes

### 3. Improved Error Handling (`src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`)
- **Structured error responses** with consistent format
- **Security-aware error messages** (no sensitive data leakage)
- **Error categorization** by type and severity
- **Request correlation IDs** for debugging
- **Environment-specific error details** (development vs production)

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Redis Caching Service (`src/services/cacheService.ts`)
- **Intelligent caching** with TTL management
- **Cache invalidation** strategies
- **Query result caching** with automatic cache warming
- **Pattern-based cache deletion**
- **Connection pooling** and health monitoring

**Cache Strategies:**
- User profiles: 30 minutes TTL
- Doctor search results: 10 minutes TTL
- Appointment data: 5 minutes TTL
- Static data: 24 hours TTL

### 2. Performance Service (`src/services/performanceService.ts`)
- **Database query optimization** with caching
- **Batch query processing**
- **Paginated query optimization**
- **Cache-aware data retrieval**
- **Memory usage monitoring**

**Key Features:**
- Optimized user profile retrieval
- Cached doctor search with filters
- Intelligent cache invalidation
- Performance monitoring integration

### 3. System Monitoring (`src/services/monitoringService.ts`)
- **Real-time metrics collection**
- **Performance monitoring** (response times, throughput)
- **Health checks** for all system components
- **Alert system** for critical issues
- **Resource usage tracking**

**Monitored Metrics:**
- Request success/error rates
- Response time percentiles (P95)
- Database query performance
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Memory and CPU usage

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### 1. Automated Backup Service (`src/services/backupService.ts`)
- **Scheduled database backups** (daily at 2 AM)
- **File system backups** (weekly on Sundays)
- **Backup retention policies** (30-day default)
- **Backup verification** and integrity checks
- **Disaster recovery procedures**

**Backup Features:**
- PostgreSQL database dumps
- File system archives (tar.gz)
- Backup metadata tracking
- Automatic cleanup of old backups
- Backup status monitoring

### 2. Alert System
- **Threshold-based alerting** for critical metrics
- **Error rate monitoring** (>10% triggers alert)
- **Response time alerts** (>2 seconds P95)
- **Memory usage alerts** (>80% heap usage)
- **Database health monitoring**

## Implementation Details

### Environment Variables Added
```bash
# Security
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-256-bit-encryption-key-in-hex-format-64-characters-long
HASH_SALT=your-secure-hash-salt-for-data-hashing

# Performance & Monitoring
DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10
DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=5000

# Backup Configuration
BACKUP_DIR=./backups
```

### New Middleware Integration
The main application (`src/index.ts`) now includes:
- Enhanced security headers
- Request sanitization
- Security logging
- Performance monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Health Check Enhancements
The `/health` endpoint now provides:
- System metrics overview
- Database and cache health status
- Memory usage statistics
- Backup status information
- Overall system health assessment

### Metrics Endpoint
New `/metrics` endpoint provides detailed system metrics:
- Request statistics
- Performance metrics
- System resource usage
- Health status of all components

## Security Compliance

### Healthcare Data Protection
- **HIPAA-compliant encryption** for all medical data
- **Access logging** for audit trails
- **Data anonymization** capabilities
- **Secure data transmission** with TLS
- **Role-based access control** enforcement

### Security Best Practices
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **SQL injection prevention** via parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** through CSP and input filtering
- **CSRF protection** via secure headers
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Improvements
- **50% reduction** in database query times (via caching)
- **30% improvement** in API response times
- **90%+ cache hit ratio** for frequently accessed data
- **Sub-200ms response times** for cached endpoints
- **Horizontal scalability** support via Redis clustering

### Monitoring Thresholds
- Response time P95: < 2 seconds
- Error rate: < 5%
- Cache hit ratio: > 85%
- Memory usage: < 80% of available heap
- Database connection pool: < 80% utilization

## Testing
