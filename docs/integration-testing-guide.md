## Running Integration Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: Required for database and Redis containers
2. **Node.js**: Version 18+ for both backend and frontend
3. **Environment Setup**: Proper `.env` configuration files

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Or use the comprehensive test runner
node scripts/run-integration-tests.js
```

### Manual Test Execution

#### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm run db:push  # Setup database schema
npm test -- --testPathPattern=integration
```

#### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- --run
```

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres redis
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Backend: Configure database URLs, API keys
   - Frontend: Set API endpoints, external service keys

3. **Test Data**:
   - Tests create and clean up their own test data
   - Isolated test database recommended

## Test Configuration

### Backend Configuration (`jest.config.js`)
```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  testMatch: ['**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts'],
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/__tests__/setup.ts'],
  collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**/*.ts'],
};
```

### Frontend Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: './src/test/setup.ts',
  },
});
```

## Test Data Management

### Test User Creation
- **Patients**: Created with complete profiles and medical history
- **Doctors**: Created with verified licenses and specializations
- **Admins**: Created with full system permissions

### Test Cleanup
- Automatic cleanup after each test suite
- Isolated test data to prevent conflicts
- Database transaction rollbacks for failed tests

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Reports
- JSON format test reports generated in `./test-reports/`
- Coverage reports for code quality assessment
- Performance metrics for optimization insights

### Continuous Integration
- Automated test execution on code changes
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Failure notification and reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failures**:
   - Ensure Docker containers are running
   - Check database connection strings
   - Verify network connectivity

2. **External API Failures**:
   - Check API key configuration
   - Verify service availability
   - Review rate limiting settings

3. **Test Timeouts**:
   - Increase timeout values for slow operations
   - Check system resource availability
   - Optimize test data setup

4. **Browser Compatibility Issues**:
   - Update browser drivers
   - Check feature support matrices
   - Verify polyfill configurations

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run tests with debug output
DEBUG=* npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --testNamePattern="specific test name"
```

## Best Practices

### Test Design
- **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
- **Cleanup**: Always clean up test data
- **Mocking**: Mock external services appropriately
- **Assertions**: Use meaningful assertions with clear error messages

### Performance
- **Parallel Execution**: Run tests in parallel when possible
- **Resource Management**: Properly manage database connections
- **Caching**: Use appropriate caching strategies
- **Optimization**: Optimize test data creation and cleanup

### Maintenance
- **Regular Updates**: Keep test dependencies updated
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear test documentation
- **Monitoring**: Monitor test execution times and failure rates
- **Refactoring**: Regularly refactor tests for maintainability
